# Library-System
Many say Libraries are dying. I think they just evolved. Welcome to Eclipse. A library system that constitutes a real man at the touch of your hand. Yes, with tech you can find most things online in a snap of your finger but what if everything you need is right at the tip of your fingers. Imagine textbooks that cost an arm or a leg accessible for for a small period of time using a token system. This platform has screenshot blocking system to protect copyright and allows new up and coming authors also to publish their books for a minor fee. This gives not just the reader the edge but also the publisher. Making your ebook accessible and also affordable.
